A site where official solutions of statistic course are published soon after they are available.

## Project purpose:
People were fed up with waiting for the statistic solutions. The teacher promised he would have published them soon after they were available, but that was a lie. By hacking his site I noticed they have been already saved but not published yet, so I downloaded them all and built this site wich allow you to see them right now. From time to time I will update the site with new solutions.

## How it was made:
The site was made using a **NodeJS** hosted in **Heroku**. **Materializecss** has been used for the style and **pug** as the markup template. The solutions are pure **html**, downloaded from the teacher's site.
